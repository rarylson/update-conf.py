# From 'setuptools' docs:
#     "Automatically include all relevant files in your source distributions,
#     without needing to create a MANIFEST.in file"
# However, 'samples/update-conf.py.conf' wasn't being included in sdist. We
# don't know if it is a bug. Anyway, we're creating our 'MANIFEST.in'.
