# From 'setuptools' docs:
#     "Automatically include all relevant files in your source distributions,
#     without needing to create a MANIFEST.in file"
# From Python sdist docs:
#     "If you donâ€™t supply an explicit list of files (or instructions on how
#     to generate one), the sdist command puts a minimal default set into the
#     source distribution:
#     [...]
#     - all files that matches the data_files metadata"
# However, 'samples/update-conf.py.conf' wasn't being included in sdist. We
# don't know if it is a bug. Anyway, we're adding it into our 'MANIFEST.in'.
