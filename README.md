Generate config files from `conf.d` like directories.

Split your config file into smaller files, called snippets, in a `conf.d` like directory. The generated config file will be the concatenation of all snippets, with snippets ordered by the lexical order of their names.

Files ending with `.bak`, `.old` and other similar terminations will be ignored.

This project was based on the [update-conf.d project](https://github.com/Atha/update-conf.d).

Install
-------

This project works in Python 3 (3.7 or newer).

To install:

```bash
pip install update-conf.py
```

It's possible to clone the project in Github and install it via `setuptools`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rarylson/update-conf.py.git
cd update-conf.py
python setup.py install
```

Usage
-----

To generate a config file, you can run something like this:

```bash
update-conf.py -f /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```

The example above will merge the snippets in the directory `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d` into the file `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`.

If the directory containing the snippets uses a diferent name pattern, you can pass its name as an argument:

```bash
update-conf.py -f /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf -d /etc/snmp/snmpd.d
```

It's also possible to define frequently used options in a config file. For example, in `/etc/update-conf.py.conf`:

```ini
[snmpd]
file = /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
dir = /etc/snmp/snmpd.d
```

Now, you can run:

```bash
update-conf.py -n snmpd
```

To get help:

```bash
update-conf.py --help
```

### Config files

`update-conf.py` will use the global config file (`/etc/update-conf.py.conf`) or the user-home config file (`~/.update-conf.py.conf`) if they exist.

You can use the the sample config file (provided within the distributed package) as a start point:

```bash
cp ${prefix}/share/update-conf.py/update-conf.py.conf /etc/update-conf.py.conf
```

It's also possible to pass a custom config file via command line args:

```bash
update-conf.py -c my_custom_config.conf -n snmpd
```

### More examples

Suppose you have 2 snippets. One is `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d/00-main`:

```ini
syslocation Unknown
syscontact Root <root@localhost>
```

And the other is `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.d/01-permissions`:

```ini
rocommunity public 192.168.0.0/24
```

After running `update-conf.py -f /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`, the generated config file will be:

```ini
# Auto-generated by update-conf.py
# Do NOT edit this file by hand. Your changes will be overwritten.

syslocation Unknown
syscontact Root <root@localhost>

rocommunity public 192.168.0.0/24
```

There are cases when it's useful to change the prefix used in the auto-generated comment. After running `update-conf.py -f /etc/php.ini -p ';'`, the generated config will start with:

```ini
; Auto-generated by update-conf.py
; Do NOT edit this file by hand. Your changes will be overwritten.
```

It's also possible to set the prefix used in the auto-generated comment via config file. For instance, in `/etc/update-conf.py.conf`:

```ini
[php]
file = /etc/php.ini
dir = /etc/php.d
prefix_comment = ;
```
